        John, a wealthy 60 year old man, shows up at the country club one day
        with his new wife, a smoking hot 22 year old blonde.

        His buddies are amazed. "There is no way someone that young and
        attractive would agree to marry an old geezer like you. How did you pull
        it off?" "It's simple," John says, "I lied to her about my age." "Did
        you tell her you were 50?" his friends ask. John shakes his head no.
        "There is no way she could believe you were 40". John shakes his head
        again. "So how old did you tell her you were exactly??" John smiles and
        says "85".
